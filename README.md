This data was collected at PyCon 2014 in Montreal, Quebec. Companies were asked
if they were open to hiring remote developers.

The CSV file included provides the company name, the city the company provided
as their headquarters, and their response.

- -1 - Company expressed no interest in hiring any remote developers
- 0 - Company expressed interest with limitations
- 1 - Company expressed interest in remote developers

Two companies present at PyCon closed their booth before I was able to ask them
any questions.

If you have any questions about how this data was gathered, feel free to
